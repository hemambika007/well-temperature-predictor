# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model using linear regression to forecast oil well temperatures based on the Volve Oil Field dataset (2007-2010).

## Files
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing data.
- `model_training.py`: Contains functions for training and evaluating the model.
- `main.py`: The main script to run the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required dependencies.

## Instructions
1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Place your dataset in the appropriate path.
3. Run the project: `python main.py`
